# Python-for-Everybody
This repository contains my work while completing the specialization created by University of Michigan on **Coursera**.
As an auditor, I completed the 'Python for Everybody' course online, which was a comprehensive introduction to programming in Python.

#### About the specialization: ####
_Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python. Develop programs to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data._

This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, youâ€™ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.
